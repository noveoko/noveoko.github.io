# Hello, I'm Marcin Kraszewski

I'm a passionate front-end developer and UI/UX designer with over 5 years of experience creating beautiful and functional websites and applications.

## My Journey

My journey in web development began when I was a teenager, building simple websites for friends and family. What started as a hobby quickly grew into a passion, and I decided to pursue it professionally.

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science from [Your University], I worked with several agencies and startups, honing my skills and developing a deep understanding of user experience design and modern front-end technologies.

## My Approach

I believe that great websites are a perfect blend of aesthetics and functionality. My approach to development focuses on:

- **User-Centered Design**: Understanding user needs and creating interfaces that are intuitive and enjoyable to use
- **Clean, Efficient Code**: Writing maintainable code that performs well across all devices
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with the latest technologies and best practices

## When I'm Not Coding

Outside of work, you can find me:

- Hiking in the mountains
- Reading science fiction novels
- Experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen
- Contributing to open-source projects

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in new projects and collaborations. Feel free to [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to work together!
